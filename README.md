# mix-tape
Final project for WATS 1020 

The MixTape.com is a webpage that has featured DJs create weekly video playlists for MixTape. 

The site will be built using bootstrap.

Video playlists will be embedded using YouTube API.  

Subscribers will join the email list to get notification of new playlists as they are posted and links to archived content. They will fill out the form to join by entering a name and email address. When the form is validated they will get a “success” message.
