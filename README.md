# mix-tape
Final project for WATS 1020 

theMixTape.com is a webpage featuring DJs who create free weekly video playlists for subscribers. 

The site was built using bootstrap.

Video playlist is embedded using YouTube API.  

Subscribers join an email list to get notification of new playlists as they are posted and links to archived content. 

The subscription form requires entering a name (letters only) and a valid email address. Form is validated using jQuery. 

A “success” message appears after the submit button has been clicked.
